## Interactive Prototype

The following tasks are interactive prototypes supported by the system:
- A back button (in the shape of a chevron arrow) on every screen that allows the user to go to the previous screen. This fulfills the heurisitic of user control and freedom where they have a choice to go back to the previous screen.
- Multiple input fields with blinking cursors that prompt the user to fill them in when answering the question(s) on the screen.
- Error prevention popups, such as red text and a red warning icon next to the area where the user has been an error, so that they can receive feedback in case they forget to fulfill a task.

In the wireflow, the screens going through the center horizontally next to the home screen are each of the default screens of the separate tasks in order. The screens above the screens in the center are screens with error prevention (red icons, red error text) for when the user forgets to fill in an input field that is required by the system.

Each screen also has a back button (facilitated through the chevron arrows) that allows the user to go back to the previous screen when they click on it.

## Cognitive Walkthrough


## Reflection

##### Things I would want to add or revise when editing my prototype:
- Allow the user to go back to the home screen by clicking on the top lefthand logo at any point during the process of creating their profile.
- Maybe the global font sizes smaller so that they are a more standard size for computers.
- Find an alternative way to display the "photo rules" to the user when they get to the part in the process of uploading their photo (e.g. make another button that leads them to another screen listing all the photo rules).
- Make the chevron "back button" arrow more noticeable by making it into more of a button than a shape on the screen (e.g. had a black square border around the arrow to make it look like a button:.
